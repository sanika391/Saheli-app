## Further Enhancement Ideas:

1. **Community Engagement Campaigns**: Organize workshops, webinars, or awareness campaigns to educate and empower women on safety practices and app usage.
2. **Partnering with governments**: We want to collaborate with government authorities in this mission to get street lighting data, crime data, to further empower our safety route feature.
  
3. **Partnerships with Local Authorities**: Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and local authorities to integrate Saheli into existing safety infrastructure and emergency response systems.
  
4. **Gamification Elements**: Introduce gamification elements within the app to incentivize users to actively contribute to the crowdsourcing of safe zones and report unsafe areas.
  
5. **Real-time Safety Alerts**: Implement a feature that provides real-time safety alerts based on user location and reported incidents, keeping users informed about potential risks in their vicinity.
  
6. **Peer Support Networks**: Facilitate the creation of peer support networks within the app, allowing users to connect with nearby individuals for assistance or companionship during travel or emergencies.
